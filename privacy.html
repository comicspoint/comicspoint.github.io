    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      ComicsPoint is an open source project.  There is no legal entity (company)
      associated with this project, only developers who donate their time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project does not collect any information about anything you read
      with ComicsPoint, except as noted below with Google Analytics.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project does not use browser cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
      ComicsPoint consists solely of client-side code (a HTML page, its stylesheet,
      and associated JavaScript files).  ComicsPoint does not talk to a server except
      as described below:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        When you are using ComicsPoint on this site,
        the developer is using <a href="https://analytics.google.com">
        Google Analytics</a> to track basic website activity, including URLs and
        URL parameters that are being used with the project.  This project does
        not pass any data to Google that can be used to personally identify the
        user.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you want to read comic books from
        <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>, this project
        will require you to sign into Google and ComicsPoint will let you choose a
        file from your Google Drive.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you want to read comic books from <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>,
        ComicsPoint will connect to IPFS nodes to download the book file.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Client-only Mode</h2>
    <p>
      If you are uncomfortable with ComicsPoint using Google Analytics or accessing
      servers over the network, it is totally within your rights to clone the
      <a href="https://t.me/comicspoint">ComicsPoint</a>,
      remove the GA code from the HTML, and then run a local web server to host
      your own copy to read comic books on your local hard drive.
